            If I were to ask you, “What perspective does a college student provide?” you might reply, “A heavily indebted one,” or “One damaged irreparably by an introductory philosophy class.” In other words, you might not seek out life advice from college students on your own volition. 
          </p>
            <p>
              Although I agree college students probably should not be your go-to source for financial advice or spiritual guidance, they can provide valuable advice about succeeding in the transition from high school to college.
<p>
  When I was making the transition from high school to college, I was relying on what I heard from my high school friends, family, and guidance counsellors. Although all these parties gave me valuable advice, I was still under informed in 3 important areas:
<ul>
  <li>
  Choosing the correct extracurriculars
  </li>
  <li>
Assessing a school’s various subcultures
  </li>
  <li>
How to structure my life for success in college
  </li>
  </p>
          <p>
Had I had a college student to advise me in these three areas, I would have saved myself a lot of time and stress. Luckily, that’s what College Casual is here to do today.
</p>
          <p>
Choosing Extracurriculars
            </p>
          <p>
Almost as soon as I began high school, people around me began to advise me to do things because they were “good for college.” Because I followed this advice, I ended up sinking time into activities that I had no interest in. For example, I signed on as a founder of the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Club although I knew that the club wouldn’t amount to much. We had neither the resources nor the expertise to perform any transformations, which meant that essentially we’d get together every Thursday morning to watch YouTube videos and eat donuts. Although doing almost anything else would have been a better use of my time, I chose to stick with the club because I thought it would be good for college.
</p>
          <p>
            However, when my friends and I started to hear back from colleges, many of my friends who pursued activities “for college,” underperformed. Simply being able to put something on your resume did not mean much unless you had accomplished in that extra curricular. Had my iGEM club completed an interesting transformation or won a competition, it would have meant something to college, but because it did none of those things it just took up otherwise meaningful space on my resume. At the end of the day, unless you can tell a story about your accomplishments, they are not accomplishments at all.
</p>
          <p>
            I was able to see this clearly once my friends and I heard back from schools with competitive application processes. College students have this first hand experience seeing what extracurriculars get you into college, which they can pass along to you.
</p>
          <p>
Assessing a School’s Subcultures
</p>
          <p>
            This year, the average high school had 525 students, whereas the average college had 6,365 students. That means that you could fit over 12 average high schools into one average college. Even though I went to a high school with a student body that was far larger than average (~1,200 students), I still felt that the culture was fairly homogenous. There was a clear social hierarchy and shared group interests. The same cannot be said for the vast majority of colleges; there are simply too many students. Each college has a wide variety of different subcultures, from the hippies to business majors, and its very hard to discover those subcultures from outside of the student body. 
</p>
          <p>
            Altough if you visit a college the tour guide will likely tell you about the school’s “culture,” that culture will, at best, be the most publicly presentable version of the school’s culture. The tour guides are told how to describe the culture by the college’s admissions department, leaving little wiggle room. Even if the narrative provided by the admissions department is correct, it is only one narrative and is not reflective of the school’s entire range of subcultures.
</p>
          <p>
            However, college students have been living in, and likely transitioning between, those subcultures, meaning that they can act as your secret agents at a school. They can get to know your interests, and let you know where best you’ll fit in, what clubs you should join, or what major you may like.

</p>
          <p>
            Structuring Your Life for Success
</p>
          <p>
            I know when I was in high school, my day was planned from 7:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m., and then I would typically do homework until I went to bed. In college, the average student only takes 15 credit hours of class per week, meaning that you have a lot of free time to wrestle with. The trade off of having such a small amount of time in class is that you have a lot more work outside of class (schools say you are supposed to do 3 hours of work out of class for every hour of work in class). Without a schedule, this work can pile up and you can be left feeling unhappy about what you’ve accomplished.
</p>
          <p>
            Coming up with an efficient schedule can take a lot of trial and error. For me, it means working out early in the morning before class, finding places in lecture halls to study between classes, and scheduling meetings right before or after meals. Although nobody can tell you what your schedule should look like, your personal secret agents can once again help you in the right direction. They can share tips for what variables to play around with and share tips about being more efficient when learning.
</p>
          <p>
Ultimately, college students can help you to share in the success and avoid the setbacks that they have experienced. College Casual is the perfect place to get that advice.
