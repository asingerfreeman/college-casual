            If I were to ask you, “What perspective does a college student provide?” you might
reply, “a heavily indebted one,” or “one damaged irreparably by an introductory
philosophy class.” In other words, you might not actively look for life advice from
college students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I agree college students should not be your go-to source for financial
advice or spiritual guidance, they can provide valuable advice about succeeding in
the transition from high school to college.         
                <p>
            When I was making this transition myself, I relied on reports from my high school
friends, family, and guidance counsellors. Although all of these parties gave me
valuable advice, I was still lacked information in three important areas:
                <ul>
              <li>
                Choosing the correct high school extracurriculars
              </li>
              <li>
                Assessing a school’s various subcultures
              </li>
              <li>
                How to structure my life for success in college
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
If I had a college student to advise me in these three areas, I would have saved
myself a lot of time and stress. Luckily, that’s what In Your Shoes is here for.
</p>
          <p>
            <b>Choosing Extracurriculars</b>
            </p>
          <p>
Almost as soon as I began high school, people around me began to advise me to do
things because they were “good for college.” Following this advice, I ended up
sinking time into activities that I had no interest in. For example, I signed on as a
founder of the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Club although
I knew that the club wouldn’t amount to much. We had neither the resources nor
the expertise to perform any transformations. As a result, we’d get together every
Thursday morning only to watch YouTube videos and eat donuts. Although there
were many other activities that would have been better preparation for college, I
chose to stick with the club because I lacked a proper understanding of what
colleges really look for.
              </p>
          <p>
            When my friends and I started to hear back from colleges, many of my friends who
solely pursued activities “for college,” underperformed. Simply putting something
on your resume did not mean much unless you derived meaningful experience from
that extra curricular. Had my iGEM club completed an interesting genetic
transformation or won a competition, it would have meant something to colleges.
Instead, it just took up otherwise meaningful space on my resume. At the end of the
day, unless you can tell a story about your accomplishments, they are not
accomplishments at all.
</p>
          <p>
            I was able to see this clearly once my friends and I heard back from schools with
competitive application processes. As they say, hindsight is 20-20. College students
have first hand knowledge of what kind of extracurriculars are valued, which they
can pass along to you. Instead of waiting to look back on your mistakes like us, you
can rely on In Your Shoes to decipher the college application process.
              </p>
          <p>
            <b>Assessing a School’s Subcultures</b>
</p>
          <p>
            This year, the average high school population was 525 students, whereas the
average college population was 6,365 students. That means that you could fit the
students of over 12 average high schools into one average college. Even though I
went to a high school with a student body that was far larger than average (~1,200
students), I still felt that the culture was fairly homogenous. There was a clear
social hierarchy and shared group interests. The same cannot be said for the vast
majority of colleges; there are simply too many students. Each college has a wide
variety of different subcultures, from the hippies to business majors, and it's very
hard to discover those subcultures from outside of the student body.

              </p>
          <p>
            If you visit a college the tour guide will likely tell you about the school’s ‘culture.’
That culture will most likely be the most publicly presentable version of the school’s
actual culture. The tour guides are told how to describe the lifestyle by the college’s
admissions department, leaving little wiggle room for the tour guide’s real opinions.
Even if the narrative provided by the admissions department is correct, it is only
one narrative and is not reflective of the school’s entire range of niches.</p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, college students have lived in and likely transitioned between these
niches, meaning that they can act as your secret agents at a school. They can get to
know your interests and let you know where you’ll best fit in, what clubs you should
join, or what major is best for you.
          <p>
            <b>Structuring Your Life for Success</b>
</p>
          <p>
            I know when I was in high school, my day was structured from 7:00 a.m. until 7:00
p.m., at which point I would typically do homework until I went to sleep. In college,
the average student only takes 15 credit hours of class per week, meaning that you
have a lot of free time to wrestle with. The trade off of having such a small amount
of time in class is that you have a lot more work outside of class (schools say you
are supposed to do 3 hours of work out of class for every hour of work in class).
Without a set schedule, this work can pile up and you can be left feeling unhappy
about what you’ve accomplished.
              </p>
          <p>
            Coming up with an efficient schedule can take a lot of trial and error. For me, it
means exercising early in the morning before class, finding places in lecture halls to
study between classes, and scheduling meetings right before or after meals.
Although nobody can tell you what your schedule should look like, your personal
secret agents can once again help you in the right direction. They can share tips for
what variables to play around with and share tips about being more efficient and
limiting distractions while learning.
</p>
          <p>
Ultimately, college students armed with the experience of college life can help you
to share their success and avoid their past setbacks and obstacles. In Your Shoes is
the perfect place to get that road map to college.
