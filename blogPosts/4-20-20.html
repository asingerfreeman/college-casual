            First off - congratulations on getting into college! You should by all means enjoy the rest of your senior year (despite the obstacles COVID-19 might pose). There are a couple easy things you can do <i>right now</i> to make your life exponentially easier down the road. Specifically, there are some apps that you should familiarize yourself with, some research you should do, and some habits you should develop.
          </p>
          <p><b>
            Apps You Should Download Before Entering College
          </b></p>
          <p>
            These apps are used by college students every day, and you’ll be ahead of the curve if you can figure them out now:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <u>Venmo:</u> An app used to easily transfer money, pay student organization dues, and settle up between friends
              </li>
              <li>
               <u>GroupMe:</u> An app that organizations use to communicate with their members
              </li>
              <li>
                <u>Google Calendar:</u> Your schedule will become a lot more complicated in college, so be sure to have a good calendar app. It’s surprisingly easy to miss a class or interest meeting because you forgot that it was happening
              </li>
              <li>
                <u>Your local transit app:</u> If your school is large, figuring out the public transportation system can be crucial to making it to classes on time and being efficient. At UNC Chapel Hill, the app CarolinaGo serves this purpose and most college towns have their own
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Research You Should Do</b>
            </p>
          <p>
            A couple of key factors - like your roommate, living situation, and professors - can really make a difference in the quality of your first year at school. Here are the things you should research to set yourself up for success:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <u>Class of 2024 Facebook Group:</u> Although many schools have their own optional software for matching roommates, I would highly recommend turning to your school’s Facebook group. This is where the majority of students find their roommates, and you can more thoroughly vet candidates. A crazy roommate can really ruin your first year, so it’s crucial to go the extra mile when picking one
              </li>
              <li>
               <u>Reputation of Different Dormitories:</u> Every dormitory at every school has a different culture, and these cultures can range drastically. Many people find their friend groups from their first-year living situations, so try to talk to a current student and figure out the culture in which you’d best fit
              </li>
              <li>
                <u>RateMyProfessor:</u> RateMyProfessor is a college student’s best friend when registering for classes. It shows ratings and comments from past students in certain classes. RateMyProfessor will help you avoid classes that have a crazy instructor or are bound to tank your GPA. On the other hand, you might find a super interesting professor that you would have otherwise never met
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
            
             <p>
            <b>Habits You Should Develop</b>
            </p>
          <p>
            Starting college is a lifestyle adjustment for everyone. Changing a few habits could help you get ahead in fitting the college lifestyle:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <u>Scheduling:</u> Since your schedule will vary from day to day and you’ll have more disparate commitments, figuring out how to structure your schedule efficiently can save you a lot of time. Although everyone will prefer a different schedule, figuring out which times of day you are most productive can help you with figuring out your own ideal schedule
              </li>
              <li>
               <u>Exercise:</u> If you’re someone who exercises (you can disregard this advice if not), exercising can look very different in college. Most schools have great sports-related extracurricular activities (that you don’t need to be a Division 1 athlete to participate in), but figuring out a time for a group of students to exercise together can be challenging. You’ll likely have to exercise by yourself more than before, so try to figure out how to do so enjoyably now. For those of you who prefer to exercise socially, most colleges have group exercise classes free of charge and available for all students
              </li>
            </ul>
