                <p>With the proliferation of COVID-19 and the uncertainty regarding both the duration of quarantine and the extent of its effects on education in the fall, many students are facing a difficult decision of what they should do this upcoming semester. According to SimpsonScarborough, a marketing research firm, 20% of high school graduates already plan to change their plans for the upcoming fall semester. The question of whether or not to defer college enrollment is particularly relevant for current high school seniors, most of whom have already been accepted into and chosen the college they hope to attend. We will explore some of your options and answer some questions you may have, from the perspective of a current college student.
</p>
<p>
<b>What are your options?</b>
</p>
<p>
Given what we currently know, and understanding that most colleges have yet to give any updates on next fall’s semester, current high school seniors face 3 options: starting college in Fall 2020, Spring 2021, or Fall 2021.
</p>
<p>
<b>1) Start as planned in Fall 2020</b>
</p>
<p>
The first option is to do as you had already planned, and start in Fall 2020. First, understand that there is a strong possibility that classes will be virtual and college campuses will remain closed through the upcoming fall semester. In an ideal world, colleges would open on time without any changes, but if we knew that would be the case, you wouldn’t be reading this article. 
</p>
<p>
As a current junior at UNC-Chapel Hill, I believe that at least 80% of the value of a traditional liberal arts education does not come from the classes alone. Rather, the people you meet, the relationships you build, the life experiences you gain, the lessons you learn living on your own, and the plethora of opportunities that arise from extracurriculars, social events, and spontaneous gatherings on campus offer the greatest value during your four years. In a virtual learning environment, you would essentially be gaining 20% of the value for 100% of the cost. This is not ideal, and I would advise avoiding this option. 
</p>
<p>
However, there are circumstances where you should consider starting this upcoming fall. If you are on a full-tuition scholarship, for example, and that scholarship cannot be deferred a year, then you might consider going through with a virtual semester to obtain credits. 
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you may be able to take virtual classes at a local junior college or community college, which would essentially offer you the same course credits for a much cheap price. If you choose to pursue this route, be sure to confirm with your specific college that your credits will transfer to your college that you’ll be starting at in 2021. The unfortunate truth is that many colleges will require you to apply as a transfer student if you take classes at another institution before enrolling. Also, check to see if taking courses elsewhere affects your financial aid.
</p>
<p>
<b>2) Wait a semester (defer enrollment to Spring 2021)</b>
</p>
<p>
Another option for you may be to defer your enrollment to the spring semester. In this case, you would be starting a semester later than usual, but you’d save on your first semester’s tuition. If you are worried that taking a gap year would leave you graduating a full year later, this option may be a viable way for you to graduate in 7 semesters rather than 8. 
</p>
<p>
However, I would only recommend this option if you are uncomfortable with graduating a year later and/or would prefer to save financially on a semester. Just be sure to check with your school to confirm that 1) your admission decision will not be affected, and 2) any scholarships you may be awarded remain intact. 
</p>
<p>
<b>3) Take a Gap Year (defer enrollment to Fall 2021)</b>
</p>
<p>
A third option may be to take a Gap Year, and just wait a year before starting school (as if you were currently a junior in high school). While this option sounds like the logical choice for many, there are a few key things to be aware of before deciding to take a gap year.
</p>
<p>
First, not all colleges will allow gap years. Many schools have a formal deferral process where you submit a separate application to be considered for a gap year deferral. Other schools do not have gap years at all, but require you to apply again in the next round of admission applications. However, even if your school is typically strict about granting deferrals, some schools may be lenient given the unusual situation. It is important that you understand your school’s policy.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, your financial aid package may change. Ask your school about the financial aid consequences of deferring enrollment, including both need-based aid and merit scholarships. Even if your scholarships may remain intact, need-based aid is often recalculated each year with FAFSA or CSS PROFILE, meaning your financial aid package may be adjusted if your family’s financial situation changes.
</p>
<p>
A traditional “Gap Year” means that students commit to exploring something outside of academics for a year, such as an internship, job, volunteering, or traveling. Recognize that, given the circumstances, options for what to do during your gap year will be limited. There are some official Gap Year programs that sponsor volunteering or travel abroad, but many of these are being cancelled or postponed indefinitely. While these formal programs can often be costly, keep in mind that, if you are looking to save financially, you can also create your own.
</p>
<p>

<b>What Should I Do?</b>
</p>
<p>
Before deciding one way or another, we recommend you take the following steps:
<ul>
<li>Check with your school. See if deferred enrollment or gap years will affect your admission decision.</li>
<li>Know where you stand with current college credits. Do you have AP, IB, or other college credits you earned during high school?</li>
<li>Understand your financial situation. Will your scholarships be affected if you defer your enrollment?</li>
<li>Talk with your parents. Are they helping you pay for college? Will the current economic environment cause financial strain on you or your family in the near-term that would make it preferable to wait a year?</li>
<li>Be patient. Some colleges may make announcements regarding the fall semester that will completely upend your decision, such as modified tuition or a combination of physical and virtual components. Don’t rush your decision.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
As with any decision you make, be sure to understand why you are choosing the option you decide. Are you taking a gap year to ease your financial situation by working and making some money? Do you want to volunteer and give back to the community before starting college? Do you simply just want to wait a year so that you can get a “full” 4-year college experience? 
</p>
<p>
Understanding your “why” is key to making the best decision for yourself. Acting with purpose, being intentional, and recognizing what you ultimately want will guide you in the right direction. There exists an abundance of opportunities, whether or not you defer your enrollment. Take some time before deciding, and wait for more communication from your college. The world is your oyster, even when we are living in such extraordinary times.
