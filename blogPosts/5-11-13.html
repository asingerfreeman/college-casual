                <p>Research is an integral part of the STEM experience at a university. Typically, one can do research for either credit or pay, depending on what the mentor is willing to offer. Students usually join research labs during their undergraduate careers to gain experience, publish papers, and learn about the environment of research and academia. If you are planning to obtain a PhD, it is HIGHLY recommended that you start research early. 
</p>
<p>
My general chemistry professor likened the research experience to the sorcerer’s apprentice in Fantasia. Mickey starts off in the wizard tower learning the basics, but slowly learns more and more about magic. However, when Mickey tries something without supervision or experience, the magic gets out of control. Choosing someone who is willing to take the time to train you as an up-and-coming scientist is the key to success. Although the topic of the research the mentor is doing should also be important, it should come second to their willingness to mentor you. </p>
<p>
However, having a nuturing advisor is not the be-all and end-all of a successfull research placement. Note that many students are often put under the supervision of graduate students instead of a faculty member, so don’t shut down the idea of research if the advisor seems a bit standoffish. The nature of the relationship between undergraduates and the graduate students can range from a very close friend and mentor, to very cold and harsh. If you’re going to be working with a graduate student, the amount of time they’re willing to invest in your training and growth is what will shape you into the scientist you hope to be.
</p>
<p>
Picking an advisor, or PI (Principal Investigator) ultimately boils down to (1) if their lab has enough space, (2) if your potential time commitment matches what they are looking for, (3) if you are interested in the research they are doing, and (4) if you are willing to commit to the lab long-term. To find the right PI, you should first go through a list of professors within your department and compile a list of whose research interests are similar to your own. This list is usually located on the departmental website. Don’t be afraid to look through departments that are outside, but related to, your major. These departments may provide a better match for your interests as well (also possibly a signal that you might want to pursue a major/minor in that area). Then, take some time to look through those professors' research websites and published science articles, building a small understanding of what they typically do for experiments. The experiments done in these papers are most likely what you will be doing in the lab as well. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, draft some emails and offer to meet with the professors! You’ll typically want to include who you are, a resume or CV, and why you’re interested in their research in your email. Only suggest the undergraduate research position as a possibility, as even if you don’t end up doing research with them, you may be able to build a good relationship with them! With some luck, the PI will respond in a couple days (I recommend sending it on a Tuesday morning). During the meeting that you set up, you can expect to talk about who you are, why you’re interested in the research, and why you might be a good fit for the lab. </p>
<p>
In order to ensure you want to that a lab is the right fit for you, you’ll want to take a lab tour—which the professor usually offers to do if you meet in person—and see what the setups for the experiments are like. Remember that if you commit to that lab, you will likely be spending a good 10-15 hours per week (depending on what you negotiate with the professor) doing experiments in this place. You’ll also want to meet some of the students that you’ll be working with (both undergraduate and graduate) and get a feel for the lab environment and how the professor treats their students. </p>
<p>
Ultimately, if you realize that the lab you’re in doesn’t meet your standards or doesn’t work out for you, it is definitely okay to switch into another lab! Remember, the ultimate goal of undergraduate research is to develop into a more competent scientist. This includes getting a feel of how you should think and act as a scientist in the lab and start asking deeper questions.</p>
