           <p>This is the question that almost every student asks themselves at some point throughout their college career. Opinions about where to go, what program to choose, how to fund the trip, etc. differ drastically. These questions can seem overwhelming, so this article will attempt to shed some light on whether studying abroad is right for you.
</p>
<p>
<b>
Why should I study abroad?
</b>
</p>
<p>
There are a few basic reasons to study abroad: get class credit in your major or for general education requirements, have an internship abroad, or do research abroad. Based on the programs at your school, there may be some other activities you can do, but these are the basic ones. Oftentimes, depending on your university policy, classes abroad will be pass/fail, which is attractive if you have some difficult required classes. Having an internship or doing research are also great learning experiences, not to mention that studying abroad is something interesting to talk about in an interview. Later, I’ll talk a bit about the more intangible aspects of studying abroad.
</p>
<p>
<b>
When should I study abroad?
</b>
</p>
<p>
I believe there are two prime times to study abroad during a college career, the first being the summer after your freshman year, and the second being the second semester of your junior year. 
</p>
<p>
Summer after freshman year is ideal because it is difficult to land a solid internship as a freshman. Studying abroad over this summer gives you valuable real world experience and shows you are willing to take risks and push yourself out of your comfort zone. Depending on the program you do, you could place into an internship in your field of interest, get ahead on classes in your major, or knock out some general education requirements. It is a great growing experience for any freshman and is powerful to talk about in interviews sophomore year, while also giving you an idea of whether or not you would like to study abroad again.
</p>
<p>
Second semester junior year is also a prime time to study abroad, especially if you would like a longer experience. You will likely have finished with recruiting in the fall and have an internship lined up for the summer, but if not, companies are typically very accommodating about doing virtual interviews. By studying abroad junior year, you also will not miss any of your senior year. Like a summer study abroad, you could do a program that places you in an internship and/or knocks out classes. One downside of a semester study abroad is missing a semester at your home university, but if it is something you are passionate about, this should not be a deterrent. 
</p>
<p>
<b>
How can I get funding for study abroad?
</B>
</p>
<p>
Studying abroad is almost always more expensive than your average semester at your home university. Even if the tuition is the same as usual, other costs including housing, food, traveling, and more can quickly add up. One of the best ways to get extra money for studying abroad is to apply for scholarship opportunities, both through your school and outside of it. These can often be competitive, but if you put in the time and are able to explain why studying abroad is so important to you, they are achievable. You should also talk to your school’s study abroad office to see how financial aid can be used for study abroad, as policies vary school to school and person to person. Once you are abroad, you should budget and think about which trips are important to you.
</p>
<p>
<b>
How do I know where to go/which program to choose?
</b>
</p>
<p>
This decision of where to go can depend on a lot of factors, but it ultimately comes down to personal preference. Research the different countries you are interested in and the host university. Do research on the programs offered by your school, but, depending on the robustness of your school’s study abroad capabilities, there will likely be a program that fits your criteria in any country you would want to go to. 
</p>
<p>
This decision of which program to choose also boils down to what you want to get out of an experience abroad. Do you want an internship? Do you want to do research? Do you want to be able to take that super hard class in your major pass/fail? Think critically about how your study abroad program fits into the rest of your college journey in terms of academics and professional development.

</p>
<p>
The best advice I can give about choosing a study abroad location and program is talking through the options with others. Talk to older students who have done the programs, talk to any teachers from your school that may be teaching classes in the program, talk to your friends and family, talk to anyone and everyone who could give advice. Try to visualize what you would be going into when you step off the plane so you can make an informed decision as to whether it is right for you or not.
</p>

<b>
What could I gain from a study abroad program?
</b>
</p>
<p>
Of course, there are the obvious things I mentioned earlier: get class credit, do an internship, do research. But, at the risk of sounding like that annoying kid who won’t shut about his study abroad, I will explain some of the things that I gained from my experience. 
</p>
<p>
I go to college about 30 minutes away from my house and had rarely left the U.S. until my summer study abroad to Beijing after my freshman year. Through this experience, I was able to gain a feeling of independence and drastically increase my confidence in what I can accomplish. This growth has helped me to push myself throughout my college career and led to subsequent successes.
</p>
<p>
Another fun part of studying abroad is the friends you meet during the program. At your home university, you meet diverse individuals, but you still live in the bubble of your university. With a study abroad program, you often meet and bond with people from different schools in your home country and others. You also meet local students, who typically love to show off their school and can become lifelong friends as well. 
</p>
<p>
One more great aspect of studying abroad is you are able to get to know another place like you know your home university. You find restaurants you love, a good place to work out, parks to explore, and are able to make the area you are in feel like home. This is a useful experience to have because it is something you will have to do after you finish college and move to your new home. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, studying abroad was a positive experience for me and I would recommend it to anyone who asked, but it is a large commitment personally, financially, and time-wise. It is not for everyone, so think critically about if or how you want to go abroad. 
</p>

<b>
How will COVID change studying abroad?
</b>
</p>
<p>
In short, I’m not entirely sure. I was abroad in Copenhagen and, like many students, had to come home. As for the future of study abroad, fall 2020 is not extremely promising, but by spring 2021, things should hopefully be looking better. Be sure to follow updates from your school’s study abroad office and the U.S. Department of State. If possible, map out multiple plans for studying abroad over different timelines.
