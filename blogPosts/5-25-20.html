           <p><b>What does it mean to be a collegiate student athlete?
</b></p><p>
Many of you may be contemplating whether or not to continue athletics in college. During my high school senior cross country and track seasons, I was doing the same. However, I found my dream scenario with a successful program and supportive coaches and teammates at North Central College, so I decided to join their ranks. North Central College is a Division III school that has created a dynasty in cross country and track, winning 39 National Championships since 1975. After spending a year in this program, I want to pass on what I have learned about being a student athlete in college. 
</p><p>
<b>
Athletics as Part of your Education
</b></p><p>

Transitioning from high school, where many coaches want their athletes to merely be eligible to compete, to North Central, where academics is the focus, was a drastic change. From the beginning, my coaches made it clear that my athletic experience was part of my education. Lessons learned from athletics apply to academics and vice-versa. Being able to translate lessons from different situations and use them in other parts of life is a critical skill. In the classroom or workplace, you often have a team of people working towards a goal. Similarly, being a college athlete, you also get a myriad of people trying to help you succeed. 
</p><p>

As a freshman runner at North Central, I had a ‘Big Brother’, who was a teammate helping with the transition, another teammate as an Academic Mentor, and a Faculty Mentor. Additionally, I also had the standard college counselor. If I had not been on the cross country and track team, I wouldn’t have had nearly as much support for my academics. Having so much support as a freshman was crucial, because it is far easier to start out well than it is to have bad grades and try to recover. These mentors also assisted in the transition into college, which oftentimes is the most difficult part. 
</p><p>

One aspect that makes the transition so difficult is finding and creating a new social group. I found mine in my team, and I believe this is why I did not have a problem transitioning. When students have a stable social circle, they can better focus on academics because they feel secure in that part of their life. I also found that continuing to run created a constant in my life that was calming when I was entering into a period of stark change.  
</p><p>
<b>
Gaining Structure
</b></p><p>

I learned quickly that I have a lot more time and freedom in college. Instead of spending eight or more hours at school, I would spend only two to three hours a day in class. It is very easy to take advantage of all the free time and get lazy. I was surprised to find that having significant time devoted to athletics made me more focused on academics. My program’s routine also created discipline that many students may lack when given so much freedom. 
</p><p>

When given more freedom than ever before, combined with the lack of an accountability structure, many students struggle to find their footing. A significant portion of my day was given to athletics, so I had much less time to waste. With less time, I found myself setting aside certain amounts of time for coursework, treating it more like practice time. That was the time to focus on my academics, just as practice was the time to focus on my athletics. If I had more time, I may have taken a more relaxed approach, and procrastination would have become more of an issue. Taking away time forces you to focus when you need to and allows you to work ahead. 
</p><p>

The routine that the program provided me has proved to be beneficial. I am a routine-oriented person, so I naturally enjoyed falling into a set plan. Without the routine however, I would not have approached academics with the same plan I described above. There were some days where I would mix up the routine to prevent it from becoming monotonous. But the routine provided an efficient way to go about my day. As you can see in the chart below, my day started early, but this allowed me to take an 8:00AM class. Normally 8:00AMs would not be ideal, but since I was already up, I could get one class done right away. Not shown in the chart is after dinner, which was primarily time for coursework and being with friends.

<p>


I do believe it is important to note that I am in a Division III program, so I am not receiving a scholarship. I am competing because I want to improve and enjoy it. My coaches also take the same approach, thus making my experience more relaxed. Someone on a scholarship may be under more pressure to perform for fear of losing their scholarship. That being said, I think the lessons learned from my first year on the cross country and track team at North Central are universal. 
</p>
<p>

Going to college can be a stressful and tumultuous time, but that is why it’s important to have mentors. I love my sport, and I found the right program with the right values to support my student athlete experience.
