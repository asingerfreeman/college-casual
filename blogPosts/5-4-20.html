                <p><a href="../mentors.html#ARI">By Ari Singer-Freeman</a></p>
                <p>You might be wondering, “Why should I pursue a double major if it would be double the work for the same diploma?” Well, according to census data compiled by economic researcher <a href = "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/pay-get-double-major-college">Christos Makridis</a>, liberal arts majors who double major with a STEM major earn 9.5% more after graduation than those who do not. Also, students who have 2 liberal arts majors earn 3.6% more than those with a single liberal arts major. Although it is not clear cut that everyone should pursue a double major, it’s an option worth at least considering. In this blog post, I’ll examine the main arguments for and against pursuing a double major.
</p>
<p>
<b>1) Pursuing a double major leads to a more well rounded education</b>
</p>
<p>
Many proponents of a double major will argue that learning extensively in two discrete (or complimentary) fields gives students a more well rounded and useful education. According to research done at <a href= "https://commons.lib.jmu.edu/sls/1/">James Madison University</a>, students with a double major are 17.4% more innovative than those with a single major.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I wouldn’t have been able to found In Your Shoes without what I learned from both of my majors: business and computer science. A prerequisite to our success was creating a professional website, a feat requiring some knowledge in computer science. Although there are various free website-building tools, none would have fit our need for a unique website. Similarly, without my business education, I would not have been able to help focus the organization’s mission as effectively. I also would not have known how to go about starting an organization. </p>
<p>
Critics of this argument will raise the point that liberal arts schools already have general education requirements that lead students to learn across disciplines. This counter argument relies on how effective a school’s liberal arts curriculum is. My experience at UNC has been that students typically aim to knock out these requirements with easy classes that lack serious content. Even if these requirements served their purposes, taking one class in English during your first year of college is unlikely to drastically improve your writing skills, especially three years later when you have graduated. However, at other schools, the liberal arts curriculum is more comprehensive, which does decrease the need for a double major.
</p>
<p>
<b>
2) Pursuing a double major prevents you from pursuing other, more valuable, educational opportunities
</b>
</p>
<p>
The merit of this argument rests on the definition of ‘opportunities.’ and your unique situation. If by opportunities, one means extracurricular opportunities, pursuing a double major may or may not be pernicious depending on your situation. Many double majors have classes that overlap and many students enter college with credits from AP or IB tests. In these cases, a student will likely have extra space in his or her schedule to take classes for a second major, meaning that he or she will not have to overload. However, if a student pursues two very different majors and doesn’t have credits when entering college, the student may miss out on extracurricular opportunities. 
</p>
<p>
Even for students who would have to take extra classes to complete a double major, I have found that you adjust to your course load and become more efficient to pick up the slack. During the spring semester of my first year, I was in 13 credit hours and had no more than 15 hours of extracurricular activities. During the second semester of my sophomore year, I was enrolled in 18 credit hours of classes and involved in 35 hours of extracurriculars. Despite a 46% increase in classes and a 133% increase in extracurricular involvement, I didn’t feel an increase in stress or that my load was unmanageable. The circumstances forced me to be more efficient, which is not an entirely bad thing. Therefore, students who will have to take extra classes will be able to do so without endangering their ability to partake in extracurricular activities.
</p>
<p>
There is more of an argument, however, that pursuing a double major prevents you from pursuing academic opportunities. Although I am a bit of a unique example because my two majors do not share any common classes and I am studying abroad for a year, I feel that I am missing out on diving deep in my two majors. Since I don’t have the time to take all the classes that I think would be useful, I am left with a less complete understanding of certain concepts than my peers. Especially with computer science, I feel that my education would have been more complete had I not also pursued a business major. For this reason, some may refrain from pursuing a double major if the two majors they are interested in are not closely related.
</p>
<p>
<b>3) Pursuing a double major allows you to follow your passion and remain practical</b>
</p>
<p>
The argument here is pretty straight forward. Although oftentimes we have a passion for pottery or jazz clarinet, we know that the job market for potters and musicians can be tough. Pursuing a double major allows you to continue partaking in activities that you’re passionate about while also giving you training that is valued by the conventional job market. This is a great argument for two reasons. First, people who leave behind passions from high school when they enter college often feel sad about doing so (more to come on this next week). Second, employers often like to get to know a person’s personality, and a second major that you’re passionate about can be a great way to showcase your personality.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, your decision to pursue a double major should come down to how those majors will fit in your schedule and whether you are passionate about both of those majors.
