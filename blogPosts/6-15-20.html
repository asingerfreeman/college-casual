                <p><a href="../mentors.html#NIB">By Nic Bollis</a></p>
          <p>
My name is Nic Bollis and I am a junior at Norther Illinois University majoring in chemistry with an emphasis in biochemistry and a minor in biology, psychology, and history. I also perform research in the field of analytical organic chemistry. Like most of you, I performed well in high school, was a member and officer of many clubs, and volunteered on many different projects, including several mission trips to Mississippi, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Detroit. Confident in my accomplishments thus far, I applied to many colleges with the hope of eventually making it into medical school to become a pediatric cardiologist. I was accepted to many, some with significant scholarships. But I choose my local community college, IVCC. 
</p>
<p>
At first, my decision was all about the money. A pressing concern was the massive pile of debt accumulating after medical school, or any university for that matter. I wanted to mitigate the damage as much as possible, and community college would help me keep my student debt low. After spending time here, I began to realize there was more to community colleges than just cost saving. I found that it’s the perfect choice. 
</p>
<p>

Because of the path I have chosen, I need to take challenging courses: Calculus, Chemistry, Physics, and one of the toughest, Organic Chem. Regardless of whether I started at Northern or U of I or IVCC, I’d take these course my first two years. And they were as difficult as I imagined they would be. 

</p>
<p>

The thing that sets IVCC apart from other Universities is that these subjects and courses, while extremely difficult and maddening, are made better here because the faculty that teach them will bend over backwards to enable their student’s success. The professors have routinely showed that they not only care about us as students, but also as people. These professors and the welcoming atmosphere of staying in my local community made the school feel like a second home. 
</p>
<p>

Because of the amazing faculty and programs, I was extremely prepared by the time I graduated and enrolled at Northern. There are countless examples of how myself and my best friends, who transferred with me from IVCC and are also chemistry majors, were far more prepared than those who started at the University. The two major distinctions between us and them was lab performance and how much we knew from previous classes. In our Analytical Chemistry lab, the three of us would go into the lab, follow the procedure and get great results, as opposed to many of the other students who were constantly struggling to perform the experiments and achieve the same results. This is due to the lab policies of the professors here and how well the labs are explained and performed. Because I am majoring in chemistry, many of the concepts taught in the first two years of classes are compounded continuously with every other class. Because of the fantastic professors I had at IVCC, and how much they care about their students learning, I had a leg up on many of the other students who did not seem to have as strong of a foundation. Don’t get me wrong, Northern is a great school and I have had nothing but wonderful professors, but there are certain things that will never live up to the standard set by IVCC. 
</p>
<p>
	
I urge you not to discount your local community colleges when making the big decision. I could have gone just about anywhere after high school. I chose IVCC, and years later I know I’m better off as a student, and better off as a person, that I would be if I had gone anywhere else.
