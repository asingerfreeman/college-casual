When I first came to college, I had no idea whether or not I wanted to be involved in greek life. As the oldest in my family, with British parents, the only reference I had was John Bellucci’s toga parties in Animal House and the posts of some of my older friends on social media. Now, as a rising junior at WashU, I’m part of the of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and will be living in the house next semester. However, I remember how stressful the rush process can be, and depending on the school you decide to attend, greek life can appear to dominate the social scene. In this article I hope to provide some perspective, outlining a few key benefits, and helping you navigate the basics of greek life at your school. 
</p><p>
My first piece of advice to anyone even remotely considering joining greek life is to attend rush. Rush gives you the chance to meet members of each fraternity/sorority and have conversations with current members. Even if you are on the fence, this gives you the chance to figure out where you might fit, and who you can see yourself spending time with. For some schools, rush is first semester as soon as you get to campus, while for others it takes place in the second semester. Figure out when your school’s rush is and how it works and begin talking to upperclassmen as soon as you get to campus. Ask about the chapter’s social life, how close they are, and what sets them apart from other chapters on campus. Having gone through rush and being on the other side, I think it’s important to come into rush with questions that you want to ask each chapter. At the same time, you also want to have 3-4 go-to things that you can talk about that make you interesting and avoid small talk. Whether that be a hobby, sports team, music, or a summer job – anything that you can use to develop connections with members and show your true personality.  
</p><p>
Following rush, if you receive a bid (or multiple) from a fraternity/sorority it is up to you whether or not you want to join. Joining a greek organization was a big change in my college experience, and there are a number of factors that I wish I had been more aware of:
</p><p>
1.	The first thing that should influence your decision, in my experience, is your pledge class or “pc.” Make sure you like the people in your year, and want to spend time with them, because you will be in the same fraternity/sorority for the next four years. These are the people you are going to go out with to social events, study with for exams, and have your back when things get tough – even though you got a bid, you have to be sure that they are the right people for you. 
</p><p>

2.	From my experience, it has definitely been a significant time commitment. There are usually multiple meetings each week, social events, and it is expected that you get to know all of the members. The good news is that most of the older members will carve out time to get to know you. Unlike high school where you generally only close with the people in your grade, greek life allows you to get to know people across all years. 
</p><p>

3.	Understand the monetary costs of joining greek life. In my chapter, for example, we have dues each semester that go to nationals, social events, and other items. Based on your chapter and school, these fees can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars per semester, so it is important to factor this into your decision. 
</p><p>

4.	Depending on the school you go to, and when your rush takes place during the year, joining a fraternity/sorority will likely shift your social circle. It might become more difficult to see friends in other chapters, but it gives you the chance to meet new friends that will stay with you for life. 
</p><p>

Overall, I have really enjoyed my experience in greek life at WashU, and I can’t imagine my college life without it. It is certainly a nerve-racking process, especially for freshman who are largely unfamiliar with the social scene on campus. Don’t set your sights on one chapter when you first start out – talk to as many people as possible across different houses and give them an equal chance. If you are confident in yourself, and stay on top of the process, you will find the best fit for you.
