If you’re anything like me, advocacy is a huge part of your life. Throughout high school, I was always looking for ways to get involved and create change in my community. Going to college, as you are probably aware, is a huge change from high school. All of a sudden you are surrounded by a ton of new people, living by yourself and everything you thought you knew has been completely flipped upside down. When I first arrived at college, I was so excited to get involved with campus advocacy, but I had no idea where to start. Information was being thrown at me right and left, and I had no idea how to navigate through my university’s hundreds of clubs and find a couple of things that I could get involved with to make a change in my new community. However, through lots of trial and error, I feel that I have finally found my place on campus a year later, and I have been able to get involved in a ton of really cool projects that are working to advocate for the students around me. While it is no easy challenge, I am positive that all of you are going to have no problem getting involved in on-campus advocacy. To make this easier, I have compiled a couple of tips that would have made it easier to find my place on campus. 
</p>
<p>

1.	Get involved in your first-year community! If your residence hall (dorm) has a community government, this is a perfect way to get involved on your campus and try out a little bit of everything! At the beginning of the year, by chance, I saw a flyer that said I could run for community governor of my 1,000-person residence hall. While I had no idea what I was getting into, this was a perfect way to get involved in on-campus advocacy while also making friends and having fun while doing it. My community had two social justice advocates, and throughout the year we worked with a ton of different social justice organizations working on different issues related to advocacy. Through being involved in community government, I was able to work with a ton of different organizations and see the advocacy work they were doing, and this led to me applying and being selected to be the Executive Social Justice Advocate for the residence hall association at my school. I would 100% recommend applying to your residence halls community government, as this is one of the best ways to start your advocacy career at your college. If you don’t have a community government in your residence hall, then student government is also a great way to get involved with advocacy on campus. Through student government, I have also been able to look at and work on a ton of different advocacy issues on campus, and this is also a great way to be exposed to different groups working on different issues affecting students. 
</p>

2.	Attend interest meetings and ask upperclassmen about their experiences! At the beginning of the year, your college will likely have something resembling a “week of welcome” for first-year students where you can visit and learn about different student organizations. While it may be hard to try a ton of new things at once, it is crucial to attend as many of these events as possible. Seeing what these organizations are working on is a crucial part of getting involved with on-campus advocacy and can help you to narrow down the organizations that you most want to get involved with. Also, talking to people in these organizations is a huge help. You are going to want to like the people you are working with, so seeing how different students like the organizations they are representing relating to advocacy can be a really big help! While it is hard to talk to new people, having a list of questions in your head about the different organizations you are trying out and writing down notes in your phone can be super helpful in finding the advocacy groups you want to get involved with. 
</p>
<p>
3.	Visit your campus social justice center! While this looks different on every college campus, find out if your campus has a social justice center or something similar, and go talk to people in it! Colleges often have social justice centers (or in my case, there are two), and this is where a lot of really important advocacy work is happening on campus. While it can be overwhelming to look at all these centers are doing, showing up to your campus center and looking at the different things that they are working on can be extremely helpful. Find a couple of things that you would be interested in working on, and see if these groups are having interest meetings or find the email of the person in charge and send an email introducing yourself. This is a great way to learn about advocacy happening on your campus and find the issues that you want to be working on.
</p>
<p>
4.	Try out a ton of new things (and don’t be afraid to switch it up! After learning about all of the different advocacy groups on your college campus, it may be hard to just choose a couple. It is completely ok to try out several different things, and see what you like best! Once you join an organization, there is often a misconception that you have to stay in it for the rest of the year. If you feel like the work you are doing isn’t meaningful to you or you like something else better, that is completely ok! Trying new things is what college is all about, and it is best to try a ton of different things and see what issues are most meaningful for you to be working on.
</p>
<p>
5.	Look at the specific issues that are affecting students at your school, and find out what you can do to help!- THIS is huge. Different campuses have different issues that affect them, and while this is a challenge, it is super important to listen to the students around you and see what issues are most affecting them on campus. This is a great way to see which issues you should be working on, and look for organizations that are working to advocate for students that are affected by these issues.
</p>

While navigating through college is difficult, most upperclassmen would agree that by the end of their first year they started to figure out their place on campus. With that being said- don’t worry if you feel like you aren’t making a difference right away! Getting involved in the activities that are right for you takes time, and while this is frustrating, you are going to find your place on campus eventually. There is SO much going on on college campuses, and something really difficult for me to learn is that it is impossible to be involved with everything. That being said, while it is often hard to see that impact you are making on campus, every little thing you do is making a big difference in the lives of those surrounding you on a college campus. I am so excited for all of you to start your journey in on-campus advocacy, and I wish you the best of luck starting the best 4 years of your life!
